# Reinforcement-Learning

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of core **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** concepts, including tabular methods and function approximation, to solve elementary RL problems. It covers standard RL frameworks, policy evaluation, dynamic programming, and advanced techniques like Q-learning and SARSA.

## Key Topics
- **Reinforcement Learning Framework**: Overview of RL elements and Markov decision processes (MDPs).
- **Tabular Methods**: Policy iteration, value iteration, and dynamic programming.
- **Monte Carlo Methods**: Approximate dynamic programming.
- **Temporal-Difference (TD) Methods**: SARSA, Q-learning.
- **Function Approximation**: Extending RL to larger state spaces.

## Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)
